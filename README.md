# SequentialRenamer

SequentialRenamer is a lightweight and user-friendly GUI tool designed to help users organize and rename files in a folder. By sorting files based on their creation time, it renames them sequentially (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.), making file organization simple and efficient.



## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:  
  Powered by `tkinter`, the GUI provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for selecting folders and processing files.

- **Time-Based Sorting**:  
  Files are renamed in order of their creation date, from the oldest to the newest.

- **Sequential Renaming**:  
  Files are renamed in numerical order while retaining their original file extensions.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Any issues during the renaming process are displayed in detailed error messages.

- **Reusable Tool**:  
  Easily select new folders and process files multiple times without restarting the program.



## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7 or newer**  
  Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Dependencies
SequentialRenamer uses standard libraries (`os`, `pathlib`, and `tkinter`), so no additional packages are required. These libraries come pre-installed with Python.
